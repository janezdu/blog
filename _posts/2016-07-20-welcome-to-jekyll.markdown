So it's the middle of the summer -- two-thirds of the way through, actually -- and I have just spent a _very productive_ weekend reading about the pains and perils of graduate study. The crux of it is that I've come across some intriguing writings/blogs that a) I want to remember and share, and b) have inspired me to write down some of my own thoughts.

For now, the articles themselves (note that I don't necessarily agree with all the opinions expressed, but I definitely enjoyed them.)
- [Philip Guo's academic website](http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm) and particularly his memoir, [Ph.D. Grind](http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm)
