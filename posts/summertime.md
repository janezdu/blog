title: Summertime

So it's the middle of the summer -- two-thirds of the way through, actually -- and I have just spent a _very productive_ weekend reading about the pains and perils of graduate study. The crux of it is that I've come across some intriguing writings/blogs that a) I want to remember and share, and b) have inspired me to write down some of my own thoughts.
