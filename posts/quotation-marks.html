  <h2>Quotation Marks</h2>
  <p>So, to state the obvious -- English grammar is particular and difficult. I had the a strict English teacher in grades 11 and 12 who put her all into making sure that we, her students, would never commit horrors like comma splices. </p>
<p>Actually, she was an amazing teacher, and the more that I look back, the more that I realize it was rather incredible that she was able to push such difficult, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_school#Canada">archaic, even</a> grammar-school lessons that most teachers really don't bother with anymore, while still being loved and respected by almost all the student body that she taught. She was one of those "legendary" teachers, so to speak.</p>
<p>I use British grammar and spellings, as is the norm in Canada. This means (among a mess of other things) that ending punctuations like commas and periods go outside of fragment quotations. As an example, the following is "American English":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Templeton did not know the meaning of the word "play."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>whereas this is "British English":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Templeton did not know the meaning of the word "play".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, it's that small, that annoying, that Grammar-Nazi-esque.</p>
<p>To be fair,  "Canadian English" consists mostly of knowing that things can be spelt/spelled in two ways sometimes and being able to choose whichever is most convenient. I find that British English makes more sense in those stickier grammatical situations and is used more often in formal speech. For example, it makes more sense to me to isolate the word "play" as an atom in the overal sentence about Templeton. </p>
